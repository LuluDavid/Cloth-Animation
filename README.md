# Cloth-Animation
This is a cloth animation where a cloth is designed as small particles linked with springs.
You can modify the parameters (wind, particle mass, etc...), but you will soon see that the system quickly becomes chaotic.
It is because of the limits of Hook's law when particles come closer to each other.
Open the main file, and play with the parameters of the helperFns file !
